# Microprocessors, Peripherals and Interfacing Lab

This repository contains assembly language programs and interfacing assignments based on the Microprocessors, Peripherals and Interfacing Lab. The lab provides practical experience with 8085/8086 microprocessors and focuses on low-level programming, instruction sets, and interfacing with hardware peripherals.

## Objectives

- To implement algorithms using assembly language.
- To understand microprocessor instruction sets and architecture.
- To design and implement basic interfacing circuits.
- To gain hands-on experience with 8255A, 8279, ADC/DAC, and memory interfacing.

## List of Experiments

### Assembly Language Programs (8085/8086)
1. Add two 16-byte numbers.
2. Swap two 8-bit numbers.
3. Add first N natural numbers and store the result.
4. Find maximum and minimum of two 8-bit numbers.
5. Find maximum and minimum of 10 numbers.
6. Count odd and even numbers in a list of 10 numbers.
7. Find the sum of a series of even numbers.
8. Count number of 1â€™s in register D and store in register B.
9. Sort 10 numbers from memory location 2200H in ascending order.
10. Multiply two single byte unsigned numbers.
11. Multiply two 8-bit numbers using logical instructions.
12. Multiply two positive floating-point numbers.
13. Divide a 4-byte number by another 4-byte number.

### Time Delay and Subroutines
14. Introduce a 100 ms delay and display numbers from 01H to 09H sequentially.
15. Create a 20 ms delay subroutine using register pair BC; clear Z flag without affecting other flags.

### Interfacing Experiments
16. Interface a display circuit and display data stored in a RAM table.
17. Interface an ADC using 8255A in memory-mapped I/O.
